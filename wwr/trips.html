                The hiking-focused rafting trip begins in Stillwater Canyon along a scenic stretch of the Green River, where the well-known and picturesque White Rim formation is more pronounced and ripe for exploring, weâ€™ll venture out on at least one unforgettable hike each day, days are both active and restorative. Nights bring delicious guide-prepared meals, good conversations with friends and family, and a vast desert sky thatâ€™s ripe for stargazing. Itâ€™s a unique vacation that takes you far away from the crowd.
